The following CSS code snippet exhibits an uncommon error related to specificity and inheritance:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green; /* This rule is unexpectedly overridden */
}

.special p {
  color: purple; /* This rule works as expected */
}

<div>
  <p class="special">This text is purple.</p>
  <p>This text is blue, not green.</p>
</div>
```

The `div p` selector should ideally override the `div` selector's color setting for paragraphs within divs, but instead the `div` selector's color is applied to the paragraph. This is not an error in the code, but in understanding the implications of cascading in CSS. The selector `div p` is only slightly more specific than `div`. This is a common pitfall for developers familiar with programming languages where inheritance has a clearer linear relationship.  CSS specificity is more nuanced.
