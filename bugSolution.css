To resolve this issue and make the `div p` selector override the `div` selector, you can increase its specificity. There are several ways to do so:

1. **Increase Specificity:** Use a more specific selector, for example, by adding an ID to the div or using an extra class on the paragraph. 

```css
#myDiv p {
  color: green; /* This will now override */
}

.myClass p {
  color: green; /* This will now override */
}

<div id="myDiv">
  <p>This text is green.</p>
</div>

<div>
  <p class = "myClass"> This text is green.</p>
</div>
```

2. **!important (Use Sparingly):** As a last resort, the `!important` flag can be used but is generally discouraged due to its potential to create maintainability problems. 

```css
div p {
  color: green !important; /* Works, but generally avoid */
}
```

Remember that understanding CSS specificity is crucial for effective styling. Always prioritize more specific selectors, and only resort to `!important` if absolutely necessary.
